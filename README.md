### Hi 👋

I'm Roy, a second year CS student @ [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/about/) and I strive to create solutions to everyday problems. I am interested in machine learning and full-stack development. <br><br>
Currently, I'm on my first co-op term @ WSIB Insurance as a full stack developer.

### 🧑‍💻 Some of my projects include:
- virtual.ai 🤖, an AI system that can understand and respond to users through various input modalities, including speech and handwritten text. Langchain powered full stack application, similar to ChatGPT enhanced with speech + text detectors
- codevision 🕶️, a platform that allows users to share their personal coding projects and portfolios.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- LLMs + Deep Learning
