## Hi 👋

I'm Roy, a second year CS student @ [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/about/) and I strive to create solutions to everyday problems. I am always learning more about machine learning and app development.

- Incoming SWE Intern @ Vivid Seats on B2C Web Team 🎟️
- Building Wagr.ai, a startup that leverages AI to pick out best sports betting picks and identify areas of arbitrage. I'm currently training/fine-tuning Cohere models and building the frontend MVP 🎰
- Previously interned @ WSIB as a software developer on innovation team 🧪

## 🧑‍💻 Some of my projects include:
- QueryGPT 🤖, an AI system that can understand and respond to users through various input modalities, including speech and handwritten text. Langchain powered full stack application, similar to ChatGPT enhanced with speech + text detectors
- codevision 👓, a platform that allows users to share their personal coding projects and portfolios.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- LLMs + Deep Learning
