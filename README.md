I'm Nicholas, a 3rd-year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. This Fall, I'm interning as a Software Engineer at [Kiavi](https://www.kiavi.com/)! Previously, I interned as a Software Engineer at [Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com) and as a Frontend Engineer at [Faire](https://www.faire.com/). Seeking **Summer 2023** software internships and always interested to hear about any cool projects you're working on!
